# Weather Classification

🌦️ Weather Classification AI
A machine learning-based system designed to classify weather conditions from images or sensor data. This project leverages computer vision and/or time-series analysis to identify weather types such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, and more.

📌 Features
- 🌤️ Classifies multiple weather conditions with high accuracy
- 🧠 Built using google collab
- 📸 Supports image-based or sensor-based input
- 📊 Includes training, evaluation, and visualization tools
- 🔁 Easily extendable to new weather categories or data sources

🧰 Installation
Directly use in Google Collab.
